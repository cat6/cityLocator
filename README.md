cityLocator
===========

A widget for getting cities' co-ordinates by name - now with streetview images!

This is a fun little script I put together one night that lets you enter a city name and then compare data between them
from places with the same name from throughout the world.  For example, compare Athens Greece to Athens Georgia, Athens Texas, Athens Tennessee, etc..

Makes use of Google's geolocation and streetview APIs.
